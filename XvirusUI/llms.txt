# Neutralinojs Project

This is a Neutralinojs desktop application that replaced the previous
Electrobun-based launcher. the UI runs in the system browser engine and
communicates with the native side through the global `Neutralino` object.

IMPORTANT: do **not** use Electron/Electrobun APIs or patterns; all native
functionality is available via methods documented below.

## Documentation

## Quick Reference

Common tasks you will need while maintaining XvirusUI:

- Show open file dialog
  ```ts
  const files = await Neutralino.os.showOpenDialog('Title', { filters: [...] });
  ```
- Window controls
  ```ts
  Neutralino.window.minimize();
  Neutralino.window.hide();
  Neutralino.window.setTitle('My app');
  ```
- Notifications
  ```ts
  Neutralino.notifications.create('Hello', { body: 'world' });
  ```
- System tray
  ```ts
  Neutralino.os.setTray();
  Neutralino.os.setTrayMenu([{ id:'open',text:'Open' }, ...]);
  Neutralino.events.on('trayMenuItemClicked', handler);
  ```

## About

Neutralinojs is a lightweight cross-platform framework that uses the
operating system's native webview instead of bundling Chromium. Binaries
are small and start quickly; many of the features previously implemented
with Electrobun's bun process are now executed directly in the renderer.
